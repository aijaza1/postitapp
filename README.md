Postifly is a dynamic and engaging web application that I developed as a personal project to expand my full-stack development skills. This app incorporates secure sign-in authentication and offers users the ability to create and interact with posts. Users can share their thoughts, which are then showcased prominently, and they can also engage with the content by liking and commenting on posts. Postifly highlights my capability to design an appealing front-end interface while effectively managing data and functionality in the backend.
